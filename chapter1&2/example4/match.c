/*
The send and receive operations themselves are flexible. For instance, when
a message is sent to a port, its queue may be full. If the queue is not full,
the message is copied to the queue, and the sending task continues. If the portâ€™s queue is full, the sender has several options (specified via parameters
to mach msg() :

1.  Wait indefinitely until there is room in the queue.
2. Wait at most n milliseconds.
3. Do not wait at all but rather return immediately.
4. Temporarily cache a message. Here, a message is given to the operating
system to keep, even though the queue to which that message is being
sent is full. When the message can be put in the queue, a notification
message is sent back to the sender. Only one message to a full queue can
be pending at any time for a given sending thread.

The final option is meant for server tasks. After finishing a request, a server
task may need to send a one-time reply to the task that requested the service,
but it must also continue with other service requests, even if the reply port for
a client is full.
